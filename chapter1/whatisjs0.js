// JavaScript is a versatile and popular programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. It's often referred to as the "programming language of the web" because it's an integral part of web development, enabling features like interactive menus, animations, and dynamic content updates. 
// Here's a more detailed explanation:
// Client-Side Scripting:
// JavaScript primarily runs on the client-side, meaning it executes directly in the user's web browser. This allows for immediate user interaction and dynamic updates without requiring a full page reload. 
// Dynamic Content:
// JavaScript enables web pages to change and respond to user actions, making them more interactive. For example, a user might click a button, and the page could update with new information or display an animation without a complete refresh. 
// Integration with HTML/CSS:
// JavaScript works in conjunction with HTML (for structure) and CSS (for styling) to create a complete web page experience. 
// Server-Side (Node.js):
// While primarily client-side, JavaScript can also be used on the server-side through frameworks like Node.js, allowing for more complex web applications. 
// Beyond Web Development:
// JavaScript has expanded beyond web development and is also used in mobile app development (e.g., with React Native) and even game development. 
// Interpreted and Compiled:
// JavaScript can be interpreted (executed line by line) or compiled (pre-processed) for better performance, particularly through engines like V8 in Chrome. 
// Dynamic Typing:
// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning the type of a variable is determined at runtime, which provides flexibility but also requires careful attention to type checking. 
// Prototypal Inheritance:
// JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance, a concept where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects, rather than classes.
