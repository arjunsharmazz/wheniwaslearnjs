// In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. Here are the rules and conventions for naming variables:
// Rules for Naming Variables:
// Start:
// Variable names must begin with a letter, an underscore (\_), or a dollar sign ($).
// Subsequent Characters:
// After the first character, variable names can include letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.
// Case Sensitivity:
// JavaScript is case-sensitive, so age and Age are considered different variables.
// Reserved Words:
// You cannot use reserved keywords (e.g., function, class, return) as variable names.
// Unicode:
// Most Unicode letters can be used. 
// Naming Conventions:
// Camel Case:
// The most recommended convention for JavaScript is camel case, where the first word is lowercase, and subsequent words start with an uppercase letter (e.g., dogName).
// Descriptive Names:
// Variable names should be self-explanatory and describe the stored value. For example, use firstName instead of x. 
// Underscore Usage:
// The underscore (\_) can also be used as a placeholder variable, especially in cases where the variable's identity is not important. 
// Variable Declaration:
// JavaScript uses the keywords var, let, and const to declare variables.
// The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables. 
// Example:
// JavaScript

let userName = "John Doe";
const PI = 3.14;
var _temp = 10;
