// Comments in JavaScript are used to explain code, improve readability, and prevent certain lines from being executed. They are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.
// There are two main types of comments in JavaScript:
// 1. Single-line comments:
// Begin with two forward slashes (//).
// Any text following // on the same line is considered a comment.
// Useful for short explanations or disabling a single line of code.
// JavaScript

//    // This is a single-line comment
//    let x = 10; // Initialize x to 10
// 2. Multi-line comments (block comments):
// Begin with /* and end with */.
// Any text between /* and */, including multiple lines, is considered a comment.
// Useful for longer explanations, documentation, or disabling large sections of code.
// JavaScript

//    /*
//    This is a multi-line comment.
//    It can span multiple lines.
//    */
   let y = 20;
   console.log(y)
// JSDoc Comments:
// Begin with /** and end with */.
// Used to generate documentation for your code.
// Can include tags like @param, @returns, @author, etc., to describe functions, parameters, and more
