# JavaScript Learning Projects

This repository contains my JavaScript practice work as I learned the language.  
Topics covered:
- Variables and data types
- Functions and loops
- Arrays and objects
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Simple web apps

I'm always improving, and this repo grows as I learn more!
